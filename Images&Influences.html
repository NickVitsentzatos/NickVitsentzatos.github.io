                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although it can be a challenge at times, I always manage to find my way and write beautiful code.
                        It is something that I am quite passionate for because I wish to maybe be a programmer for a video game
                        company in the future. I've only learned C# as of now but I have to learn many languages in the future
                        and hope to become a programmer who is very flexible to code in many languages.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cyber Security is a topic that was breefly touched on in our Information Technology course.
                        It is a field that is also a topic of interest for me as there are many big companies hiring
                        and many oportunities in this field. It's also a very interesting topic as it allows you to
                        dive deep in security and can provide many interesting life skills.
                    </p>

                    <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Web design can be a serious pain at times and is a lot of trial and error, but it is still an 
                        interesting field for me. The skill of being able to make beautiful websites is an extremely useful
                        skill because even when not working in the a job related to Computer Science this skill will spike
                        interest in any employer. The world is ran by the internet and being able to create a website will
                        get you far.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Networking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everyone experiences network problems all the time. We all we know those times when our internet cuts
                        out or when something just isn't working. If I learn how to properly route and deal with networks in the
                        future it will be an amazing tool to have. Companies will happy to hire someone who is capable of helping
                        with network issues whenever they may occur and if you are able to help yourself and other around, you are
                        a very valuable employee.
                    </p>
